# Arbitrary Precision Calculator (APC)

## Description
The Arbitrary Precision Calculator (APC) is a C program that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on integers of **any size**.  
It uses **doubly linked lists** to store each digit, allowing calculations beyond the limits of built-in C data types.

## Features
- Handles very large integers without overflow.
- Supports:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction (with negative results)
  - Multiplication
  - Division (quotient and remainder)
- Implemented entirely in C without external libraries.
- Efficient digit manipulation using doubly linked lists.

## How It Works
1. **Input Handling**  
   The program takes two numbers and an operator as **command-line arguments**.  
   Example:
   ```bash
   ./apc 9876543210123456789 + 1234567890987654321
   ```

2. **Linked List Storage**  
   Each digit is stored in a node of a doubly linked list, enabling:
   - Easy traversal from either end
   - Simple carry and borrow operations

3. **Arithmetic Logic**  
   - Addition and subtraction work digit-by-digit from the least significant digit.
   - Multiplication uses grade-school multiplication logic adapted for linked lists.
   - Division uses repeated subtraction and comparison to generate quotient and remainder.

4. **Output**  
   Prints the result for `+`, `-`, and `*`.  
   Prints both quotient and remainder for `/`.

## Example Usage
```bash
$ ./apc 999999999999999999999999 + 1
Result: 1000000000000000000000000

$ ./apc 123456789123456789 * 987654321
Result: 121932631234567900112635269

$ ./apc 123456789 / 10000
Quotient: 12345
Remainder: 6789
```

## Compilation
To compile the program:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c11 main.c inser_last.c insert_first.c addition.c subtraction.c multiplication.c division.c other_functions.c -o apc
```

## Applications
- Arbitrary-precision arithmetic
- Educational tool for learning linked list data structures
- Basis for cryptography or scientific computation requiring large number handling
